# Word Processor
A graduation work at 2013

## Notice
This project was no longer maintained.

If you need work this project on each machine. You must fix errors and convert codes to current environments.

## Concept
I noticed cooking and studying are so similar. Both of them examine, execute, digest. Doing same routine.
This installation art is metapher of human thinks and process of growing.

When experiencers are facing this art, they give a little affect a human routines.

## How it works
Processing components are crawring wikipedia pages automatically and collecting words then stacking in screen.
If experiencers push a button, disassemble to alphabets and mixed it up.
